We have measurements and simulations. Measurements cant give the statistics because there's only one sample. So we instead do many simulations to find covariance of a measurement.

Cant have large covariance matrices because hard to invert, ill conditioned. For matchinf theory to experiment, we need to do something like exp[(T-D)^2/\sigma^2] for gaussian processes.

So we'd like to match a smaller set of parameters between theory and expt, some \tilde B(B), a low dim function of bispectrum which would therefore have a smaller covariance matrix.
